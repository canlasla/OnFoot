ECE297 Geographic Information System (GIS) Semester Project

Check out the demo video [here.](https://canlasla.github.io/personal-website/gis)

This project was divided into four milestones:

## Milestone 1 
Read a database of all the intersections and streets and other geographic features in a city and organized it into appropriate data structures 

## Milestone 2
Drew the resulting map nicely and let the user interact (pan, zoom, highlight, search for locations, etc.) with it.

## Milestone 3
Find good travel routes between intersections in the city and give directions to a user. 

## Milestone 4
Find a good order of deliveries and a good driving path for a courier company driver to complete his/her list of daily deliveries.
